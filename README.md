This is a small project done to get familiar with Rmarkdown. To see the results of the analysis, see the [ActivityMonitoringDataAnalysis.md](https://github.com/TemiPete/Rmarkdown/blob/master/ActivityMonitoringDataAnalysis.md) file. The raw data explored is in ['./data'](https://github.com/TemiPete/Rmarkdown/tree/master/data).
